        <h2>About Thomas</h2>

        <p>Hey all, glad you came to check out my website! My name is Thomas and I'm currently enrolled in the February 20th, 2023 App Academy Boot Camp cohort.</p>

        <p>I got started out in tech in 2019 as a Cyber Security Engineer coop at Wayfair. I then went on to work in robotics for a little over two years as a robotics support engineer. During that time I also had the opportunity to work as a UX Research Assistant at Northeastern. I'm now happy and excited to say I am continuing my education and preparing to re-enter the work force as a software engineer!</p>

        <p>My current focus is on the basics of html, css, and javascript.</p>

            <h3>Notable Favorite Projects:</h3>
            <div class="project">
                <p>My first ever project, created in 2015: The adventures of French Toast Man. This was my first ever, full-fledge (and super ugly) web site created in my 'Intro to HTML' class in conjunction with my 'Graphic Design II' class when I was 16 years old.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <p>My most evil project: Phishing close to 20 thousand users for a large online retailer as part of an internal employee phishing training initiative. Lessons learned - your coworkers will in fact be very unhappy when they find out that email for a free T-Shirt is in fact, not real.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="project">
                <p>My Jack-of-all-trades project: In 2022 I flew out to Indiana to do hardware repairs on several robots, work with multiple teams to fine-tune automated robotic workflows, and actually got to meet some customers allowing me to do some in-person with them for the first time ever!</p>
